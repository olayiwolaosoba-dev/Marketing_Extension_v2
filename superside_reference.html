<!-- Actually, I will just write the provided HTML from the prompt history to a file. -->
<!-- Since I cannot copy-paste the huge string efficiently here without cluttering, I will write a placeholder for now or just rely on the prompt history. -->
<!-- Better yet, I will use the `write_to_file` with the content provided. -->
<!-- RE-READING: The user provided a MASSIVE amount of HTML. I will try to write it to a file, but maybe it's better to just analyze it from the prompt context if possible? -->
<!-- No, writing to a file is better for `read_file` tools later if I need to look up specific classes. -->
<!-- I'll grab the first chunk and write it. -->
